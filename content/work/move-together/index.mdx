### Background
<br />
This project began as the result of a UX Hackathon I did back in June 2020 (you can find v1 here).
The prompt was simple and open-ended: *design a (digital) product that helps people relocate to a new city or country.*
<br />
<br />
In v1, my team and I chose a specific aspect of moving and targeted all of our research and work towards that focus,
given the limited time we had during the hackathon. 
<br />
<br />
Months later, I noticed there were a lot of people I knew directly or indirectly moving places, which
renewed my interest in the original question. I wanted to know more about people's experiences and figure out
what I hadn't even considered in v1. In v2—this version—I dove headfirst into more exploratory user research,
until I came across a problem I thought would be interesting to solve.

### Research
<br />

#### User Interviews

Because I was looking for new information *and* anything I may have missed in a previous user interview,
I reviewed earlier research from v1 on top of speaking to more people. Similar to v1, I narrowed my scope
to people I knew had moved recently, and I maintained a short list of standard questions to cover. But
this time around, I started my conversations as broadly as possible—"So how do you feel about moving?"

From there, I let my interviewees' answers guide the questions I asked them. Even though each interview
went into different specifics, after coding and mapping the data, I found all of it could be captured
by four general themes:

<CustomImage src="themes-on-notes.png"  alt="four themes"/>

<br />

<br />

#### Key Findings & Insights

When I compiled my findings, I noticed a particular trend across these themes, which helped me articulate the audience I would be designing for.
<br />
<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'row', alignItems: 'center', flexGrow: 1, flexWrap: 'wrap', justifyContent: 'space-evenly'}}>
  {[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].map(item => (
    <div style={{ padding: 16, width: 236, maxHeight: 300 }}>
      <CustomImage src={`insight_compact_${item}.png`} alt={`insight #${item}`} />
    </div>
  ))}
</div>

<br />

#### Market Research

<br />

After brainstorming possible solutions (that ranged from "is this even possible?" to "this would be so simple to do")
and mapping them onto a feasibility matrix, I went in search of existing products that said
"[I can do zat!](https://www.popmatters.com/star-trek-i-can-do-zat-anton-yelchins-legacy-2495416138.html)"


<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'row', alignItems: 'center', flexGrow: 1, flexWrap: 'wrap', justifyContent: 'space-evenly'}}>
  <div style={{ padding: 16, width: 180, maxHeight: 200 }}>
    <CustomImage src="moving-waldo-logo.png"  alt="moving-waldo-logo" />
  </div>
  <div style={{ padding: 16, width: 180, maxHeight: 200 }}>
    <CustomImage src="moved-logo.png"  alt="moved.com-logo"/>
  </div>
  <div style={{ padding: 16, width: 180, maxHeight: 200 }}>
    <CustomImage src="task-rabbit-full-logo.png"  alt="task-rabbit-logo"/>
  </div>
  <div style={{ padding: 16, width: 180, maxHeight: 200 }}>
    <CustomImage src="sortly-logo.png"  alt="sortly-logo"/>
  </div>
</div>

<br />

I went through each product's available flows and made note of what it did well and any frustrations I had, which I then shaped into design "opportunities" I could pursue. 

<br />

Each app provided a specific value and set of features that, unsurprisingly, they each did well. They were fine tuned and comprehensive
(to an overwhelming degree in some cases). However, I noticed that none of these apps targeted what I chose to focus on: *collaboration*.
Sure, Task Rabbit could help Emily get a mover, and Moving Waldo would let her select services she wanted to set up at her new home—but
they served _only_ her.  

<br />
<br />

### Ideation

<br />

#### High level user flow

A high level overview of the main flows in the final designs-where blue is a "screen" and "green" modules
refer to flows that I further mapped out during the actual design process.

<br />
<br />

### Final Artifacts

<br />

After breaking out the high level user flow into a more detailed chart, I was able to put together
mid-fidelity wireframes/designs to reflect the main flows, and the specific problems I chose to tackle.

<br/>

#### Welcome Carousel

Moving is stressful, so the apps we use shouldn't be. I was hoping to evoke a sense of calm, warmth, and
friendliness with the color palette.

<CustomImage src="welcome-screens.png"  alt="welcome carousel"/>

<br />
<br />

#### Sign-up Flow

Signing up for something new and highly specific is often a high friction process. By attaching a user
to their email or number, they don't have to remember something new, and they can access their account
quickly at any time with the OTP (one time password).

<br />
<br />

#### First Note Creation Flow

In my user testing, a common initial reaction I got was "Wait...no plus button? Why am I swiping?" because it's
such a common pattern. For my purposes, I wanted to design a quicker, more intuitive way to interact 
with the app to create a new note. 

No one had trouble with the first swipe up motion to reveal the note screen. And most interestingly, each
person swiped back down completely naturally when they were done with the note, expecting it note to be in their "Hub."

#### Testing & Iterations

After my intial round of designs, I went back to some of the people I spoke with to gather feedback.
Below is an updated version of the "Tag a Moving Buddy Flow" I changed after someone was confused and lost about adding new media to a note without
any sense of where it would appear.

### Next Steps & Takeaways

<br />

From the beginning, this project was meant to be more of a research based exploration to validate an idea/solution (to a problem
I found from that exploration). There are dozens of other features I thought about that I didn't spec out. There are also many
little details that I think could be cases studies of their own right, such as:

- How would this app handle "box conflicts?" What would it look like to "merge" boxes if they got consolidated in real life?

- What's the best way to handle replies to a note? Threading isn't a priority, and it's not meant to be a place to chat,
so what's the best way to keep that communication clear? 

#### Metrics

To measure how much "friction" there really is:
Calculating an "accuracy score" for each action a user tries to do, factoring in how many times they are successful and how
direct of a path they take to complete the action.

To measure ease of use + speed:
Observe/track how long it takes people to create new boxes or notes, and see if there are patterns among users for the types
of notes that are more or less popular.

<br />


#### What Next?

If I were to keep going I'd first do some more rounds of user testing and convert that into a high fidelity prototype. In addition to
the scenarios above, it would be interesting to consider integrating with other apps. (For example, being able to embed Venmo request inside
a note you've assigned to someone)

<br />


#### Challenges & Lessons Learned

As a developer, I had to fight my instinct and gut throughout this process, because my brain defaults to asking "so how feasible is it
to build this and what would you need?" It's helpful to eventually define constraints, of course, but this was practice in holding those
instincts at the door when doing initial explorations.

<br />

I also learned that at some point you just have to decide what direction to take and run with it. After I had brainstormed a long list of ideas
and thoughts, I had to be very disciplined about how I cut it down to a singular idea to pursue.
