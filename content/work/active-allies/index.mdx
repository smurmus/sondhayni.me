### Background
<br />

This project came about as the result of a Social Justice-focused designathon that I participated in with two other people. The designathon presented a set of issues that each 
team could focus on, and we decided to work on a design that addressed the idea of _Sustainable Activism_.
<br />

### Process

<br />

#### Brainstorming/Aligning
When we first teamed up, we each wanted to tackle different issues ranging from racial justice to mental health, so we figured that focusing on "sustainable activism" was at the center of everything. The designathon also provided a set of personas to help direct our designs, of which we chose "Azami," a woman in her early 40s trying to connect more with current events and issues.

#### Research

Because of the limited timeframe, my team and I elected to focus our research efforts on what
was already out there--studies, articles, surveys, and research others had already done in 
areas related to our problem.
<br />
For example, we looked at papers that reported data about social media usage among different demographics, and the topics that people most engaged with in each of those demographics. To get a more qualitative understanding of peoples' feelings around activism and what "worked" vs didn't, we read stories about organized activism and articles about how different people reacted to different kinds of media related to activism.

<br />
<br />

#### Ideas

After our research, we compiled our insights to determine that it made sense to 1) make a website as opposed to a mobile app, and 2) break it into clear, big two parts: learning and acting. By making it a website, we we would be more accessible to older generations, and we wouldn't have the friction of having to go to an app store and download something new.

### Designing

<br />

#### Information Hierarchy
As a project focused heavily on content and guiding a user through it, it was important for us to establish the content/information hierarchy around what would actually be on the site.

<br />

#### Branding/Style Guide
We wanted to be consistent, of course; but we also wanted to use a calm, cool color palette that felt trustworthy, and a font that was
similarly "professional" but still friendly and accessible.
