							<p>
								I decided to design for mobile (moving involves a lot of...moving, after all. Pun intended).
								Taking what I'd learned about my target users and from existing apps, I wanted the app 
								to be <b>intuitive</b>, have a core + <b>clear purpose</b>, offer <b>quick access to important actions</b>,
								and have a <b>clean UI</b>.

								"Focus" has really been an ongoing theme across this every part of this project.
								At the start of the high-fidelity phase, I tried to make my own components/assets for things like
								a mobile top status bar. I realized quickly enough that there is a plethora of resources in the
								design community, and if mastering the Apple HIG wasn't my goal, I should use what I have at my disposal.

							<description>
								Part of being a developer is the often unpleasant task of informing your design team of technical constraints
								and proposing an alternative that can sometimes be less exciting or interesting. I had to turn off developer
								auto-pilot and make an active effort to brainstorm ideas across the spectrum of obviously easy to probably impossible before I did any thinking about
								what was actually do-able.
