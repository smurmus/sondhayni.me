          I'm a <Emphasize>creative</Emphasize> and <Emphasize>curious</Emphasize> maker who's into identifying
          possibilities and problems and playing with ways to fix themâ€”I excel at <Emphasize>listening</Emphasize> and asking questions that solve for
          what people want and need, even when they don't explicitly say it.
        <br />
          <br />
          I graduated from the <Emphasize>University of Southern California</Emphasize> with a bachelor's in Computer Engineering & Computer Science (and a minor in
        3d Computer Graphics and Modeling!) and a mission to make the world a <Emphasize>kinder</Emphasize> place.
          <br />
          <br />
          I have a lot of hobbies, so I try to split my "down" time between puzzles, writing, reading, gaming, or making art.
        <br />
          <br />
        This website is part showcase of some of my work, but mainly an exploration of identity, perspective, and
        things completely unrelated to "software engineering."
