        <p>
          I'm a <b>creative</b> and <b>curious</b> maker who's into identifying
          possibilities and problems and playing with ways to fix themâ€”I excel at <b>listening</b> and asking questions that solve for
          what people want and need, even when they don't explicitly say it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I graduated from the <b>University of Southern California</b> with a bachelor's in Computer Engineering & Computer Science (and a minor in
          3d Computer Graphics and Modeling!) and a mission to make the world a <b>kinder</b> place.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have a lot of hobbies, so I try to split my "down" time between puzzles, writing, reading, gaming, or making art.
        </p>
        <p>
          This website is part showcase of some of my work, but mainly an exploration of identity, perspective, and
          things completely unrelated to "software engineering."
