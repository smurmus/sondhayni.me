## 4/08/2020
today we are living dangerously and smashing that deploy button, unfinished pages and all.
the site is semi functional and has some basic info about me and you know what? the code is messy 
at the moment. so what. I'll fix it.

## üöÄ Things that are working
_Configuration side_
  - Basic site + nav works
  - Netlify is configured with this repo
  - Domain has https!

_Site interaction_
  - Everything now lives on just the home page!
  
## üßê What's left?

_Configuration side_
  - [ ] Getting it to deploy correctly (do I need to understand deployment for this??)
  - [ ] uhh how does graphql querying work in gatsby lol
  - [x] Figure out how to host/query/display pdf/files

_Site content_
  - [x] Add all relevant projects + links
  - [ ] Create a basic "show" page for projects that don't link out to places
  - [ ] Create a more case-study specific type show page
  - [ ] **Update resume to be the latest one (once I get feedback)**

_Site interaction_
  - [ ] **Make all pages responsive**
  - [x] Write at least (1) actual blog post (technically it's in my drafts but still)
  - [ ] Clean up the file structure
  - [ ] Clean up the styles (oh god)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ i.e. specifically and most importantly `layout.css`. that file is very scary.
  
_Housekeeping_
  - [x] the domain currently points nowhere now...so get the site up and running as an "MVP" stat
  - [ ] Archiving the old site repo, if not deleting it
  - [ ] delete any code within this project I don't understand/don't use
