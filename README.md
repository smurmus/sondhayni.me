## 4/08/2020
today we are living dangerously and smashing that deploy button, unfinished pages and all.
the site is semi functional and has some basic info about me and you know what? the code is messy 
at the moment. so what. I'll fix it.

## üöÄ Things that are working
_Configuration side_
  - Basic site + nav works
  - Netlify is configured with this repo
  - Domain has https!

_Site interaction_
  - "Home" page basically complete
  - Index view for blog + individual posts mostly set up!
  
## üßê What's left?

_Configuration side_
  - [ ] Getting it to deploy correctly (do I need to understand deployment for this??)
  - [ ] uhh how does graphql querying work in gatsby lol
  - [x] Figure out how to host/query/display pdf/files

_Site content
  - [ ] Add all relevant projects + links
  - [ ] Create a basic "show" page for projects that don't link out to places (like visual stuff)
  - [ ] Create a more case-study specific type show page

_Site interaction_
  - [x] Make all pages responsive (this is mostly true)
  - [ ] Write at least (1) actual blog post
  - [ ] Clean up the file structure
  - [ ] Clean up the styles (oh god)
  - [ ] What goes on the "about" page? Do I need/want one? What else would it be?
  - [x] ~Resume/project pages. Maybe these should be something else entirely?~ Portfolio + home links instead.
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ i.e. resume can just be a link on home, and project can be portfolio instead, which then that leaves the 4th tab free for some other creative content??
  
_Housekeeping_
  - [ ] the domain currently points nowhere now...so get the site up and running as an "MVP" stat
  - [ ] Archiving the old site repo, if not deleting it
  - [ ] delete any code within this project I don't understand/don't use
