## 🚀 Things that are working
1. Configuration side: 
  - Basic site + nav works
  - Netlify is configured with this repo
  - Domain has https!

2. Site interaction
  - "Home" page basically complete
  - Index view for blog + individual posts mostly set up!
  
## 🧐 What's left?

1. Configuration side: 
  - [ ] Getting it to deploy correctly (do I need to understand deployment for this??)
  - [ ] uhh how does graphql querying work in gatsby lol

2. Site interaction
  - [ ] Make all pages responsive
  - [ ] Write at least (1) actual blog post
  - [ ] Clean up the file structure
  - [ ] Clean up the styles (oh god)
  - [ ] What goes on the "about" page? Do I need/want one? What else would it be?
  - [ ] Resume/project pages. Maybe these should be something else entirely?
    ├── i.e. resume can just be a link on home, and project can be portfolio instead, which then that leaves the 4th tab free for some other creative content??
  
3. Housekeeping
  - [ ] the domain currently points nowhere now...so get the site up and running as an "MVP" stat
  - [ ] Archiving the old site repo, if not deleting it
